For example, letâ€™s think about how to create a House object.
 To build a simple house, you need to construct four walls 
 and a floor, install a door, fit a pair of windows, and 
 build a roof. But what if you want a bigger, brighter house,
  with a backyard and other goodies
 (like a heating system, plumbing, and electrical wiring)?
